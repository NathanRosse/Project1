# Project1
Our project will focus on 4 types of crimes in the city of Chicago;

-Assualt, Arson, Battery, and Burglary-

It will look at how these crimes have either increased or decreased in frequency in the last two decades while also analyzing where someone is most likely to be victimized. We also found it important to research the most common dates and times these crimes occur, as well as, how they are perpetrated.

## Main Dataset:
[https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/home](https://github.com/18F/crime-data-explorer)https://github.com/18F/crime-data-explorer
Chicago Crime Statistic: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2 (CSV file too large, convert using API python script to compile a formatted csv)

## Team Members:
- Josh Soundarajan
- Kelsey Sniatynsky
- Nathan Kaspar 
- Nathan Rosenberg

## Main Questions?
- What are the crime hotspots in the city, and how have they changed over time? (Kelsey)

- Where do the crimes typically take place and what is most common crime/location combination? (Josh)

- What does the date and time of these crimes tell us? Could these differ based on season? (Nathan R)

- How have arrest rates changed from 2001 to today? (Nathan K)

## Potential null and alternative hypothesis:
N0 - The south side is the biggest crime spot
Alt - Crime is starting to disseminate out of the south and into the west and east side

N0 - Most crimes are going taking place in public streets and are burglaries
Alt - Burglary occurring on streets are not the most common crime and are below other categories.

N0 - Most crime is taking place later in the evening and usually nicer weather
Alt - Crime occurs at all periods of the day and weather occasionally affects it.

N0 - These crimes are being committed with weapons available
Alt - These crimes are mainly acted out without a weapon available but the threat or indication of one.


## Breakdown of Task:
Each group member is assigned to focus on one particular question. They will extract data that specifically meets the needs of the question and organize it. After this, the data will be analyzed by each member to see the trends in relation to their question.
