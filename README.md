# Project1
Our project will focus on 4 types of crimes in the city of Chicago;

-Assualt, Arson, Battery, and Burglary-

It will look at how these crimes have either increased or decreased in frequency in the last two decades while also analyzing where someone is most likely to be victimized. We also found it important to research the most common dates and times these crimes occur, as well as, how they are perpetrated.

## Main Dataset:

Chicago Crime Statistic: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2 (CSV file too large, convert using API python script to compile a formatted csv)

## Main Questions?
- What are the crime hotspots in the city, and how have they changed over time? (Kelsey)

- Where do the crimes typically take place and what is most common crime/location combination? (Josh)

- What does the date and time of these crimes tell us? Could these differ based on season? (Nathan R)

Most would assume that illegal and criminal activities would happen at night or during the dark but they would be suprised by the amount of factors that go into account when people commit crime. Basic seasonal patterns have shown this amongst the 4 types of crime we are tracking.
Arson tends to have the the highest flux of incidents in the summer and fall seasons. Summer is somewhat self explanatory with raising heat and temperatures making fire easier to form. Fall makes more sense than Spring to have the 2nd most arson incidents as Fall starts to get colder but everything becomes dry and more brittle compared to Spring where it tends to have more moisture that makes it harder for fires to start and maintain themselves. This is somewhat self explanatory but it's hard to get a fire started in the winter without proper preperation. Even with all this, Arson rates are about several hundred but never more than a thousand per year. It tends to lean more to the night rather than day to when most Arson is committed.
Assault shows a relatively consistent trend across days and nights of each season. There is an uptick for assault more so in the Summer seasons than Spring or Fall. This could correlate with more activities going on outside and thus raising the risk of individuals coming into potential hostile contact with each other. It ranks second on average for the total crimes as occasionally Burglary might overtake it in recorded crimes for a couple years but somewhat rarely. Assault typically takes place during the day time rather than night time
Battery takes the cake with the most common crime, with incidents showing noticable rises during the Summers and Springs. While battery is the act of hurting someone, even by accident, it makes sense that it would be the highest recorded crime even amongst seasons like Winter and Fall where there is less social interations. Which is why there is a large increase of the quantity of Batteries that take place during the Summer and Spring where there are more parties and risks and opportunities to get into unforseen trouble. With the bulk of the population going out and about during the nicer and warmer weather, its raises the chance of encoutering issues. In most cases there are almost double the amount of day cases than night cases for Battery which indicates that this could be a more public and accidental than anything premeditated
Burglary at first thought would make you think that, like Battery, would occur more during the warmer seasons but that isn't neccessarily true. They tend to rise higher in the Fall and Winter seasons and are somewhat even with the crimes occuring during the night and day. This could be due to the fact that in the colder seasons, it gets darker sooner and stays that way longer, even when it turns to day it could still be fairly dark outside. The colder months would also be when there are more celebrations and vacations which let criminals break into homes that are unattended to due to the holidays.
Overtime is seems that all of our recorded crimes are decreasing from the highest counts we had up to 17500 to as low as 3000 from recent records. There could be a variety of factors as to the quantity of crimes decreasing such as general population being more law abiding or things like the Covid Pandemic where it forced a lot of people into a standstill and we are still recovering from that. But these totals have been trending downwards ever since the early 2000's by at least 50% to current date. I can only hope that our fair city is taking the right steps to reduce crime as a whole and make the community safer for everyone.

- How have arrest rates changed from 2001 to today? (Nathan K)

## Potential null and alternative hypothesis:
N0 - The south side is the biggest crime spot
Alt - Crime is starting to disseminate out of the south and into the west and east side

N0 - Most crimes are going taking place in public streets and are burglaries
Alt - Burglary occurring on streets are not the most common crime and are below other categories.

N0 - Most crime is taking place later in the evening and usually nicer weather
Alt - Crime occurs at all periods of the day and weather occasionally affects it.

N0 - These crimes are being committed with weapons available
Alt - These crimes are mainly acted out without a weapon available but the threat or indication of one.


## Breakdown of Task:
Each group member is assigned to focus on one particular question. They will extract data that specifically meets the needs of the question and organize it. After this, the data will be analyzed by each member to see the trends in relation to their question.
