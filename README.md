# Project1
Our project will focus on 4 types of crimes in the city of Chicago;

-Assualt, Arson, Burglary, and Theft-

It will look at how these crimes have either increased or decreased in frequency in the last two decades while also analyzing where someone is most likely to be victimized. We also found it important to research the most common dates and times these crimes occur, as well as, how they are perpetrated.

## Main Dataset:
[https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/home](https://github.com/18F/crime-data-explorer)https://github.com/18F/crime-data-explorer
Chicago Crime Statistic: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-Present/ijzp-q8t2 (CSV file too large, convert using API python script to compile a formatted csv)

## Team Members:

## Main Questions?
- What are the crime hotspots in the city, and how have they changed over time? (Kelsey)

- Where do the crimes typically take place and which are the most and least common? (Josh)

- What does the date and time of these crimes tell us? Could these differ based on season? (Nathan R)

- What are the main ways these crimes are perpetuated? (Nathan K)

## Breakdown of Task:
Each group member is assigned to focus on one particular question. They will extract data that specifically meets the needs of the question and organize it. After this, the data will be analyzed by each member to see the trends in relation to their question.
