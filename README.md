Questions to Ask?:
What are the crime hotspots in the city, and how have they changed over time?
Are there any correlations between types of crimes and demographic factors like income, education, or population density?
Can we predict crime rates based on factors such as weather conditions, public events, or economic indicators?

Break Down of Roles?:
Phase 1: Exploration and Cleanup (Data Preprocessing)

Role 1: Data Exploration and Initial Cleanup
One person is responsible for the initial exploration and data cleaning.
Subtask 1: Load the primary crime dataset into a Jupyter notebook.
Subtask 2: Perform basic data cleaning, handling missing values and ensuring data quality.
Subtask 3: Create initial visualizations to understand the data's structure (e.g., histograms, basic statistics).

Role 2: Data Reformatting and Additional Data Integration
Another person focuses on reformatting and integrating external data sources.
Subtask 4: Merge the primary crime dataset with data from relevant APIs (e.g., weather, demographic data).
Subtask 5: Ensure consistency and data integrity in the integrated dataset.
Subtask 6: Document the data sources and integration process for future reference.

Phase 2: Analysis

Role 3: In-Depth Data Analysis
One person is dedicated to in-depth data analysis.
Subtask 7: Perform advanced statistical analysis, including aggregation, correlation, and comparison studies.
Subtask 8: Conduct time-series analysis, if applicable.
Subtask 9: Execute sentiment analysis if there are relevant data sources (e.g., social media sentiment).
Subtask 10: Create detailed visualizations that reveal insights and trends in the data.

Role 4: Data Presentation and Summary
The last person focuses on summarizing and presenting the results.
Subtask 11: Summarize the key findings and insights from the analysis.
Subtask 12: Create visually appealing plots and visual representations of the results using Matplotlib.
Subtask 13: Prepare the content and structure for the final presentation.
